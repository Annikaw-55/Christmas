    <h2>Step three: decorations</h2>

    <p>Decorating can really get you in the festive mood! Many like to use Christmas themed colours, such as red, green, gold and more! If you are going for a more homey, classic look, I suggest colours like red, and green. If you want more of a nuetral modern look then white, and yellow might be your best call! Some ideas for where to decorate are outside your house, inside your house, your car, your bedroom, and your workspace, if you have one. Here is a video for some room decorating ideas.</p>
    <div class="Decorate">

    </div>
    <p>In my opinion the perfect time to put up decorations is beginning of December. Others may prefer late November or mid December. One of the most important decorations is the Christmas tree! This is usually a spruce, fir or pine. Some people use fake trees. I prefer a real tree, it also releases a lovely scent! You can dress your tree up with lights, <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ornament"> ornaments </a>, a star or angel on the top and a tree skirt! Lights are a big thing as well! Many people cover their houses in beautiful lights.</p>

    <h2>Step four: music</h2>

    <p>I absolutely love Christmas music, it gets me in a good mood instantly! There are many different times of seasonal songs. Some prefer classic, older music, while others enjoy the newer, more upbeat ones. I suggest figuring out which you prefer, or if you enjoy both!</p>

    <h2>Step five: activities</h2>

    <p>This is a key step to ensure an amazing time! This does also connect with traditions, which is the next section. Everybody has their preference, but some of my favourites are decorating the tree, making Christmas treats, shopping for gifts, driving around to see christmas decorations, and exploring activities near where I live! Gather some close friends and family, make some plans, and you are guaranteed to have a fantastic time! Try looking up "Christmas activites near me". This is an easy way to find fun things you can easily drive to! You can also explore the things you can do from the comfort of home! Here is a list of things to do from home!</p>

    <li>Do some decorating</li>

    <h2>Step six: traditions</h2>

    <P>Traditions make Christmas personal, and ten times better! Some of my favourite traditions are Christmas pajamas, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrfsk3Q7vOc"> Buddy spaghetti </a> , light drives, and watching Christmas movies with my family. Making a tradition is simple, gather your favourite people, try something out, and if you enjoy it do it again next year! Then the year after, and the year after that! You get to choose your traditions, so they can be best fit for you! No one is forcing you into traditions as well, nothing is for everyone!</P>

    <h2>Step seven: gifting</h2>

    <p>There is a whole section on gift giving, but I will give you a quick over view! Many people find lots of joy in giving, and also love to get something from the heart! Some people like expensive things, or large store bought products, while others prefer homemade gifts, that may cost less money, but much more love. Please visit our portion dedicated to gifting!</p>

    <h2>That's it! If you do most of these, I guarentee that you will have an awesome Christmas season! Happy holidays, and merry Christmas!</h2>
